    <p>Established in 1988, the UTSA Ambassador Program consists of a select group of 60+ student leaders. UTSA Ambassadors act as student hosts at campus events, university sponsored conferences, and community and alumni functions. Committed to service, leadership, and integrity, the Ambassadors provide more than 5,000 service hours to the University community a year.

      For the 2011-2012 academic year, the Ambassadors provided 10,778 hours of service! You may have seen the Ambassadors in action on campus at the Fall Convocation, the Information Tables at the beginning of each semester, or giving campus tours for prospective students, parents, and other campus visitors.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

      A candidate for the Ambassador program is a full-time student who has been at UTSA at least one long semester and has a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.75.
